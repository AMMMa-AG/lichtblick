	<body><strong>stop-motion cinematography (animation):</strong> An animation technique that makes a physically-manipulated object appear to move or change its shape. The object is moved or otherwise changed in small steps between individually-photographed frames (or every few frames). When the series of frames is played continuously, it creates the illusion of movement or change. Sometimes also called stop-action or frame-by-frame animation.</body>
