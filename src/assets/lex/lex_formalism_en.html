	<body><strong>formalism:</strong> In filmmaking, a particular style which favours aesthetic form over the subject matter as content. Most formalist filmmakers have no desire to show (“common sense”) reality; instead, they want to convey their individual vision of the world (or their version of reality). In formalist films, cinematic time and space are often distorted, and <a href="lex_set_en.html">sets</a>, <a href="lex_decoration_en.html">decoration</a>, <a href="lex_costume_en.html">costumes</a> and other elements of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en scène</a> may also be exaggerated. Formalist filmmakers tend to use elaborate <a href="lex_cinematography_en.html">cinematography</a> techniques (e.g. unusual uses or special patterns of <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a>, <a href="lex_camera_angle_en.html">angles</a>, <a href="lex_focus_en.html">focus</a> and <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a>). At the extreme end of the scale, formalist filmmakers may avoid the concept of a story and characters as the centre of a film altogether, instead trying to convey a particular mood or emotion by showing largely abstract pictures. At a less extreme point of the scale, a film may be formalistic with regard to just one aspect of cinematography or the mise en scène. However, since the formalist style naturally draws attention to itself, the perception of a formalist film may be felt as being more difficult than for a film of the classical or realistic style (see <a href="lex_classicism_en.html">classicism</a> and <a href="lex_realism_en.html">realism</a>). It is therefore helpful to think of a film as being more or less formalistic along a scale with the further reference points of <em>realism</em> (at the opposite end) and <em>classicism</em> (in the middle between realistic and formalistic). <br />
