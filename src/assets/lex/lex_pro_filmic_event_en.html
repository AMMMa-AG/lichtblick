	<body><strong>pro-filmic event:</strong> The pro-filmic event is the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en scène</a> that exists before it is actually filmed. The term refers to all elements in the <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a> that exist prior to and independent of the camera’s activity, which obviously includes everything that exists and can be seen prior to filming (unless we are dealing with <a href="lex_computer_generated_imagery_en.html">computer-generated imagery</a>). </body>
