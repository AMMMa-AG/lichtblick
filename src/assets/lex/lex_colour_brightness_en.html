	<body><strong>colour brightness:</strong> Lightening or darkening a colour by adding black or white is related to a modification of the colourâ€™s brightness. Adding black is referred to as <strong>shading</strong> a colour, while admixing white is termed as <strong>tinting</strong> a colour. Shaded <a href="lex_hue_en.html">hues</a> of red and orange change their appearance towards brown; yellow moves towards a greenish tinge, while hues of green and blue simply appear darker. The <a href="lex_tint_en.html">tints</a> of a colour can also be referred to as pastel colours. For related information, read the entry concerning <a href="lex_light_dark_contrast_en.html">light-dark contrast</a>. <br />
