	<body><strong>dub (dubbing):</strong> Process of adding or replacing sound after the film has been shot (i.e. in the <a href="lex_postproduction_en.html">postproduction</a> stage). Most typically, the term refers to the substitution of the voices of the actors shown on the screen by those of different performers, who may be speaking a different language, since many films are dubbed into the local language of a foreign market. Music is also usually dubbed into a film after <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a> is completed.</body>
