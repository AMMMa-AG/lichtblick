	<body><strong>steadicam:</strong> A lightweight stabilizing mount for a film camera, which mechanically detaches the operator’s movement from the camera, thus allowing smooth an relatively steady shots even when the camera operator is moving quickly over uneven surfaces. In this way, the Steadicam can be freely moved everywhere a camera operator can go but without the jumpiness and unstable, jerky feel of a <a href="lex_handheld_en.html">handheld camera</a>. The Steadicam was introduced to the industry in 1976 by its inventor – cameraman Garrett Brown. Its breakthrough movies are generally considered to be John Avildsen’s <em>Rocky</em>, which was filmed in that same year, and Stanley Kubrick’s 1980 film <span>The Shining</span>. Steadicam is a registered trademark of Tiffen. <br />
