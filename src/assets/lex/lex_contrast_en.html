	<body><strong>contrast:</strong> Refers to striking differences, mostly in terms of visual properties, which help to distinguish several objects or parts of one object from each other. In photography and art, the term typically refers to the ratio between light and dark areas in an image (see the entry concerning <a href="lex_chiaroscuro_en.html">chiaroscuro</a>). Johannes Itten developed a series of different colour contrasts with regard to opposite properties and the perceptual effects of colours that become striking when the colours are juxtaposed (see <a href="lex_colour_wheel_en.html">colour wheel</a>). Opposite of uniformity. </body>
