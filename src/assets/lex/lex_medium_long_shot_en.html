	<body><strong>medium long shot:</strong> In this type of shot, the subject is usually shown from the knees up. The subject and surroundings thus have roughly equal importance. A special form of this shot is called the “plain américain”: In Westerns, the cowboys are often shown from the thighs up, in order to show the weapons on their belts.
