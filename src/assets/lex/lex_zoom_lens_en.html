	<body><strong>zoom lens:</strong> A lens with adjustable <a href="lex_focal_length_en.html">focal length</a> that can be changed during a <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shot</a>. <a href="lex_zoom_en.html">Zoom</a> lenses with variable focal length allow <a href="lex_zoom_in_en.html">zooming in</a>, which magnifies a subject and flattens the various planes of the image by moving them closer together, and <a href="lex_zoom_out_en.html">zooming out</a>, which makes a subject seem smaller while adding depth to the image. A shot taken with a zoom lens, in which the focal length is actually changed, is called a <a href="lex_zoom_shot_en.html">zoom shot</a>. </body>
