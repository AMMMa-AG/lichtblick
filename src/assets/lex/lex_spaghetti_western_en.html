	<body><strong>Spaghetti Western (Italo-Western):</strong> Spaghetti Western, also known as Italo-Western, is the nickname given to an Italian <a href="lex_film_movement_en.html">film movement</a> and sub-genre of Western films from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s. The name derives from the fact that most of these films were produced and directed by Italians, usually in co-production with a Spanish partner, and in some cases, a German partner. Typically, the partners would insist that some of their stars be cast in the film for promotional purposes. The best-known and perhaps most typical films of this genre are <em>A Fistful of Dollars</em> (1964), <em>For a Few Dollars More</em> (1965), and <span><em>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly</em></span> (1966), all directed by Sergio Leone, starring Clint Eastwood and with the musical <a href="lex_film_score_en.html">scores</a> of Ennio Morricone.</body>
