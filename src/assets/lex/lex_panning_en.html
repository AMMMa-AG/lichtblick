	<body><strong>panning:</strong> derived from <em>panorama;</em> a movement of the stationary camera, in which the camera moves along its horizontal axis, from right to left or vice versa. A <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shot</a> in which substantial panning movement takes place is called a <em>pan shot</em>. See also <a href="lex_tilting_en.html">tilting</a>. <br />
		<br />Pans have three main functions: <ol start="" type="">
			<li>to give an overview (panorama) of a scene,</li>
			<li>to direct attention from one subject or place to another,</li>
			<li>to follow movement or action.</li>
		</ol>
		<br />A pan quick enough to blur the image is referred to as a <a href="lex_swish_pan_en.html">swish pan</a>. A pan in which the camera makes a single complete turn around itself is called <a href="lex_360_degree_pan_en.html">360-degree pan</a>.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_pan.png" src="Images/visual_pan_en.png" width="100" /></p>
