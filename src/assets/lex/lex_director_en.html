	<body><strong>director (film director):</strong> A film director is a person who directs the <a href="lex_actor_acting_en.html">actors</a> and the technical film crew in the making of a film. The director controls a filmâ€™s artistic and dramatic aspects under the guidance of a <a href="lex_producer_en.html">film producer</a> and works closely with the cast and crew to shape the film. Of special importance is the collaboration of the director with key members of the crew (e.g. the <a href="lex_cinematographer_en.html">director of photography</a>, <a href="lex_set_en.html">set</a> designer, <a href="lex_costume_en.html">costume</a> designer, <a href="lex_prop_en.html">props</a> master, sound designer, etc.). In postproduction, the director works closely with the film <a href="lex_editor_en.html">editor</a> and sound editor to ensure that the intended artistic vision is achieved.</body>
