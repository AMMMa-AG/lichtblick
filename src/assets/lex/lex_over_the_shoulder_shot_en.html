	<body><strong>over-the-shoulder shot (OTS):</strong> It is a kind of shot that is taken from over-the-shoulder of a character whose back can be partially seen (although not necessarily in sharp <a href="lex_focus_en.html">focus</a>) at the side of the frame. Although over-the-shoulder shots could suggest a certain degree of subjectivity as the audience may identify with the person whose back is seen, they should not be confused with <a href="lex_point_of_view_shot_en.html">point-of-view shots</a>. An over-the-shoulder shot helps to establish the relative positions of each character; it is thus helpful in creating spatial continuity. In addition, over-the-shoulder shots enhance the depth in a shot. A further important usage of over-the-shoulder shots is in <a href="lex_shot_reverse_shot_en.html">shot/reverse shot</a> patterns. Somewhat surprisingly, although over-the-shoulder shots are often associated with <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">continuity editing</a>, strictly speaking, they actually belong to the scope of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en sc√®ne</a>. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_over_shoulder.png" src="Images/visual_over_shoulder_en.png" width="100" /></p>
