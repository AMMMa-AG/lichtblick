	<body><strong>narration:</strong> Commentary spoken by <a href="lex_onscreen_en.html">onscreen</a> or <a href="lex_offscreen_en.html">offscreen</a> voices. These voices may be <a href="lex_diegetic_en.html">diegetic</a>, when they seem to originate from the world portrayed in the film (e.g. from one or more of the filmâ€™s characters), or <a href="lex_non_diegetic_en.html">non-diegetic</a>. However, a non-diegetic voice is usually omniscient. Narration may be used throughout a film or only occasionally, but is often used at the beginning (to introduce the <a href="lex_setting_en.html">setting</a>, characters, or the <a href="lex_story_en.html">story</a>) or at the end as a form of conclusion.</body>
