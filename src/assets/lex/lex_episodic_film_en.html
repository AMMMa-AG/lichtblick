	<body><strong>episodic film:</strong> A type of film in which different independent narrative units are combined to create a film that has the playing time of a usual feature film. A central theme or idea, or a common frame story connects the single units to a meaningful whole. <br /> Two forms of episodic films can be distinguished: <ol start="" type="">
			<li>The <strong>classical episodic film</strong> consists of multiple interwoven sub-plots, which normally depict a central theme from different perspectives and view-points. The individual sub-plots normally share roughly the same place and time, but often are linked only loosely, so that it is up to the viewer to reconstruct their intersections and establish their logical context. </li>
			<li>Films of the second form are also called <strong>anthology films</strong>. These consist of a collection of different short-films or excerpts from different feature films juxtaposed one after the other. Often, the single episodes are directed by different directors, who present different viewpoints and stories on the central theme or idea.</li>
