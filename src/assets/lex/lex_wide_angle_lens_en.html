	<body><strong>wide-angle lens:</strong> A wide-angle lens (or a <a href="lex_zoom_lens_en.html">zoom lens</a> operating at minimum <a href="lex_focal_length_en.html">focal length</a>) has a wider angle of view than a <a href="lex_normal_lens_en.html">normal lens</a>. Wide-angle lenses tend to magnify the distance between objects while allowing greater <a href="lex_depth_of_field_en.html">depth of field</a>. For cameras that use 35 mm film or an equivalent digital sensor, a lens of focal length 35 mm or less is considered wide-angle. Extreme wide-angle lenses with a focal length of 16 mm or less are called <a href="lex_fisheye_lens_en.html">fisheye lenses</a>. Because of their short focal length, wide-angle lenses are sometimes called “short lenses”. They have attributes opposite to those of the <a href="lex_long_lens_en.html">long lenses</a> (<a href="lex_telephoto_lens_en.html">telephoto lenses</a>). <br />
		<br />The effect of using a short lens is to make spatial distances more obvious. A person in the distance is shown as much smaller, while someone in the foreground will loom large. The shorter the focal length of a lens is, the more obvious its distortion of perspective becomes. Wide-angle lenses have a large <a href="lex_depth_of_field_en.html">depth of field</a>, which makes them suitable for <a href="lex_deep_focus_en.html">deep focus</a> cinematography. Movement towards and away from the camera appears accelerated and emphasized.<br />
