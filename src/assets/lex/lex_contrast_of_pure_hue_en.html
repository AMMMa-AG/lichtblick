	<body><strong>contrast of pure hue:</strong> The colours of the first and second order on the <a href="lex_colour_wheel_en.html">colour wheel</a> are the colours of the purest <a href="lex_hue_en.html">hue</a>. Colours of the purest hue have the highest luminosity, which is also referred to as <a href="lex_saturated_colour_en.html">saturation</a>. High saturation implies in turn the absence of additional colours that would break the basic colour down and reduce its luminosity and strength. When placed next to each other, colours of pure hue form a contrast that is characterized by vibrancy and excitement. Strong colours express high energy and emotion and have a natural signal effect. The further the colours are broken down, the smaller the contrast between them. The effect of a pure hue contrast can be strengthened by adding areas of white and black. <br />
