	<body><strong>axis of action:</strong> An imaginary line drawn between the two major dramatic elements in a scene, usually but not necessarily, two characters. The axis of action is a fundamental part of the <a href="lex_180_degree_system_en.html">180-degree system</a>, which stipulates that the camera can shoot from any position within the area on one side of the line, but should never cross it, since this typically disorients the audience.</body>
