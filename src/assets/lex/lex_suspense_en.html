	<body><strong>suspense:</strong> A state or condition of mental uncertainty and anxiety about the outcome of certain actions in a film. Film director Alfred Hitchcock stated that viewers experience suspense when they expect something bad to happen and have (or at least, believe they have) a superior perspective on events in the storyâ€™s hierarchy of knowledge. This is because they have advance warning but are powerless to intervene to prevent the bad event from happening. </body>
