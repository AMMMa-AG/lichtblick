	<body><strong>prequel (film):</strong> A film that supplements a previously-completed one, and that has an earlier time setting. The prequel usually delivers the “back-story” to the previously-completed film. This can be contrasted with a <a href="lex_sequel_en.html">sequel</a>, which delivers the "follow-up" or continuation of the story.</body>
