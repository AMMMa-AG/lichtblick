	<body><strong>pan and scan:</strong> Technical method that makes it possible to show a film with a widescreen <a href="lex_aspect_ratio_en.html">aspect ratio</a> on a narrower screen by adjusting the height of the widescreen material to the height of the replay screen. Those parts of the widescreen image that do not fit in the replay screen are simply cut off.<br /> The advantage of this form of transferring widescreen films into 4:3 video format is that it does not leave black bars at the top and bottom of the screen, but the obvious disadvantage is that the original aspect ratio and some of the original material gets lost.<br /> An alternative method for making such adjustments is <a href="lex_letterbox_format_en.html">letterboxing</a>.</body>
