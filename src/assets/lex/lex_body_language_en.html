	<body><strong>body language:</strong> Body language includes facial expressions and other gestures that people use to instinctively communicate their emotions in a non-verbal way. While some of the body languages codes we use and understand are universal to all cultures, others, primarily those related to rules of behaviour, differ (sometimes quite radically) from culture to culture. <br />
		<br /><strong>Examples:</strong><br /> Sweeping gestures which involve movement away from a person typically indicate an open attitude and sincerity, whereas gestures that are stilted and involve restricting movement closer to the person generally reveal uncertainty and inhibition. Raised shoulders and a lowering of the head can be a sign of anxiety or fear because the shoulders are there to protect the neck in the event of an attack. When totally relaxed, people hold their shoulders low so that the arms can move freely in a natural way without jerkiness. In addition, a personâ€™s eye can be very informative for learning something about their thoughts and emotions. For example, people looking upwards are often thinking: the upper right is seen as being related to the activation of our rational ability to think, whereas the left indicates that the person is most probably trying to develop a creative idea. Being willing to look a person straight in the eye can reveal an attitude of power and domination, while a person who avoids eye contact communicates submission. </body>
