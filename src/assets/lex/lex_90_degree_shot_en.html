	<body><strong>90-degree shot:</strong> An unusual shot, in which the camera is placed at exactly 90-degrees facing the subject (e.g. a person looking directly into the camera). This kind of shot <a href="lex_composition_en.html">composition</a> is generally avoided, since such a shot lacks the illusion of depth. The 90-degree rule stipulates that the camera should never be positioned in this way. However, many non-mainstream filmmakers like to play with the violation of this rule for various expressive purposes. </body>
