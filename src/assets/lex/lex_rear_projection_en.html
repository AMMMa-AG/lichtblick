	<body><strong>rear projection:</strong> A studio technique which involves the projection of previously-created photographs or film material onto a translucent screen (background action) with the characters acting or the action taking place in front of this screen (foreground action). The foreground action is then filmed against the background action.<br />In a <em>front projection</em>, the photographs or film material are projected onto a screen from the front, with the characters acting in front of it as well.</body>
