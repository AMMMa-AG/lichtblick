	<body><strong>gaze shot:</strong> A shot showing a character staring at something or someone that is typically outside of the frame (<a href="lex_offscreen_en.html">offscreen</a>).<br />
		<br /> Gaze shots are often used in combination with a following <a href="lex_point_of_view_shot_en.html">point-of-view shot</a>, which has the effect of putting the viewer into the position of a character for a short moment: for example, we see a character suddenly looking up into the sky (gaze shot), and then after a <a href="lex_cut_en.html">cut</a>, the next shot (point-of-view shot) shows a passing aircraft. </body>
