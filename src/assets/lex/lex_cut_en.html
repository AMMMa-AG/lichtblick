	<body><strong>cut:</strong> A cut marks the connection between two <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shots</a> and merges the end of one shot with the beginning of the following shot. In most cases, this is done by a so-called <a href="lex_straight_cut_en.html">“straight cut”</a> which means that the last <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a> of the first shot is instantly followed by the first frame of the next shot. With a straight cut, no special <a href="lex_transitions_en.html">optical transition</a> is used. As a verb, <em>to cut</em> means 1. the action of implementing a cut and 2. to change from one shot to another apparently instantaneously.</body>
