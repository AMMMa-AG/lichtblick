	<body><strong>aerial shot:</strong> An aerial shot is any shot taken from a device that is capable of flying. This can be an aeroplane, a helicopter, a kite, etc. Lighter and smaller cameras can also be carried by a variety of model aircrafts. The manoeuvrability of a camera attached to some kind of flying device depends on the size and movability of the device in question. Although in rare cases an aerial shot may be static (e.g. from a helicopter “hovering in a fixed position in the air”), it is more commonly identified with dynamic movement. Aerial shots are often used with an <a href="lex_extreme_long_shot_en.html">extreme long shot</a> framing to provide an overview of outside scenery.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_aerial_shot.png" src="Images/visual_aerial_shot_en.png" width="100" /></p>
