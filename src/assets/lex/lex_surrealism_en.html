	<body><strong>surrealism (film):</strong> A European <a href="lex_avant_garde_film_en.html">avant-garde film</a> movement stretching from the 1920s to the 1930s. This movement was concerned with Freudian and Marxist ideas and is characterized by irrational <a href="lex_setting_en.html">settings</a> and subject relations. A major film associated with the surrealist movement is <em>Un chien andalou</em> by Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dalí (1929). The surrealist movement, along with its ideas and techniques, is most commonly associated with the influence it had on many later <a href="lex_experimental_film_en.html">experimental</a> filmmakers. Nevertheless, even nowadays, many mainstream films and music videos also contain surrealistic elements.</body>
