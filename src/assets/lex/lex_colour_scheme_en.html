	<body><strong>colour scheme:</strong> This refers to a limited selection of colours. Normally, only a few, typically not more than three or four, and in most cases, more like two or three, basic <a href="lex_hue_en.html">hues</a> are brought together to create harmonic images. From these basic colours, a variety of different <a href="lex_tint_en.html">tints</a> and <a href="lex_shade_en.html">shades</a> with varying degrees of saturation are then combined. In film, a frequently used colour scheme is that of <a href="lex_monochromacy_en.html">monochromacy</a> which uses only the nuances of a single colour.
