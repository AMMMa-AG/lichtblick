	<body><strong>story time:</strong> The amount of time that is represented in the <a href="lex_story_en.html">story</a> of a film. Story time is usually significantly longer than the <a href="lex_running_time_en.html">running time</a>. For example, if a film starts with a scene occurring on Monday and the final scene takes place on Sunday, the story time is about a week whereas its running time is usually between one and three hours (in the case of a typical <a href="lex_feature_en.html">feature film</a>). In some films, the story time spans several generations or even different millennia. </body>
