	<body><strong>axial cut:</strong> An axial cut is a type of <a href="lex_jump_cut_en.html">jump cut</a>, in which the camera moves towards (or away from) an object between shot 1 and shot 2. The position of the camera changes only with regard to the <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">distance</a> while the <a href="lex_camera_angle_en.html">angle</a> stays the same. In this respect, the axial cut has a similar function to a <a href="lex_zoom_en.html">zoom</a> in (or out), but instead of the flowing “movement” of a zoom, the axial cut uses several connected shots. </body>
