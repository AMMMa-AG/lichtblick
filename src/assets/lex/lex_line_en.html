	<body><strong>line:</strong> The line is a very elementary object of visual design, not least because other basic elements like the <a href="lex_triangle_en.html">triangle</a> or the <a href="lex_rectangle_en.html">rectangle</a> consist of connected lines.<br />
		<br /> A line can be implemented in several ways in a frame: Obviously, objects or subjects within the frame can create lines, for example, walls of buildings or characters; however, lines can also emerge from <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting effects</a>, respectively <a href="lex_attached_shadow_en.html">shadows</a>, or from the contrast of areas with different colours.<br />
		<br /> In most cases, lines establish one or more <a href="lex_vector_en.html">graphic vectors</a>, sometimes even causing a certain visual <a href="lex_directionality_en.html">directionality</a> within the frame. If lines cross the whole frame horizontally or vertically, they divide the visible area into various sections which often may carry different dramatic values. <a href="lex_composition_en.html">Compositions</a> based largely on vertical lines seem visually at rest and may suggest strength and power, whereas compositions based largely on horizontal lines while also seeming visually at rest, may additionally suggest peacefulness and placidity (the <a href="lex_horizon_line_en.html">horizon line</a>, in particular, is one of the visually-strongest horizontal lines). In contrast, compositions based on diagonal and oblique lines seem dynamic and typically suggest tension, uncertainty or anxiety (see <a href="lex_canted_angle_en.html">canted angle</a>). <p align="center"><img lw-src="../bilder/lex_lines.jpg" src="Images/lex_lines_en.jpg" /></p>
