	<body><strong>studio:</strong> (1) Studio era â€“ a period in the film history of the United States, stretching from the late 1920s to the late 1940s, in which major film production companies produced large numbers of films in Hollywood film studios using a kind of factory-style division of work. In this structure, each worker had his or her own very restricted and specialized job and most of the creative control over a film was concentrated in the hands of few senior studio executives (who were not necessarily film directors or otherwise creatively inclined). The output of this kind of production system was mainly a long line of largely uniform <a href="lex_genre_en.html">genre</a> films. <br />
		<br />(2) A film studio is a controlled environment (inside and outside) specially suited for the making of a film. See also <a href="lex_set_en.html">set</a>.</body>
