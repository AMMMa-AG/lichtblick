	<body><strong>documentary (film):</strong> Non-fiction (factual) film that explores and documents the world we live in and that uses representations of actual events and real people (not performers or <a href="lex_actor_acting_en.html">actors</a>) as its raw footage. In most cases, a documentary is a relatively low-budget, journalistic record of an event, person, or place. <br />
