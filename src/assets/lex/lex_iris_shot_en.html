	<body><strong>iris shot:</strong> An iris shot was a technique frequently used in <a href="lex_silent_film_en.html">silent films</a> in which the black circle of the iris partly masks the <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a>. More often than not, the iris shot was used to signalize the passing of time, similar to a <a href="lex_fade_out_fade_in_en.html">fade-out, fade-in</a> transition. In some cases, more recent and post-silent-era films have employed (or imitated) this technique as an homage to the silent film era or to make a film sequence appear as though it might have been filmed in the silent film era.</body>
