	<body><strong>Italian neorealism:</strong> An Italian <a href="lex_film_movement_en.html">film movement</a> of the 1940s and early 1950s, which was characterized by stories set amongst poor and working class people, generally filmed on <a href="lex_location_en.html">location</a>, and frequently made use of non-professional actors. The use of strongly <a href="lex_realism_en.html">realistic</a> settings and techniques emphasized <a href="lex_documentary_en.html">documentary</a> aspects of film art. Italian neorealist films mostly dealt with the difficult economical and moral conditions of post-World War II Italy, critically reflecting the changes in the Italian society of the time and the hardships of everyday life: poverty, unemployment and desperation. One of the best known neorealist films is Vittorio De Sicaâ€™s <em>The Bicycle Thief</em> from 1948.</body>
