	<body><strong>ambiguous space:</strong> This is a special way of presenting the space visible in a <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a>. Normally, the viewer is able to identify the spatial relations within the frame. However, in some cases, the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en sc√®ne</a> of a certain <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shot</a> does not provide the necessary information about the spatial relations of the visible objects that the viewer needs in order to draw conclusions as to the correct size or location of the objects within the frame. In this way, ambiguous space can be used to momentarily disorient the viewers.<br />
		<br /> This effect can be achieved in many different ways, such as the absence of expected motion, unusual <a href="lex_camera_angle_en.html">camera angles</a>, special <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a>, constellations of mirrors or by filling the frame, respectively the background, with unidentifiable objects. Typically, such effects are used to transport a certain dramatic value.<br />
