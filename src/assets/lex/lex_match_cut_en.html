	<body><strong>match cut:</strong> A match cut is a <a href="lex_transitions_en.html">transition</a> between two <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shots</a> which typically draws attention to itself because it highlights one or several elements in both connected shots that are very similar to each other. The similarities between the shots can involve the shape, colour or movement of the featured elements (graphic match) and/or a metaphorical relation between the two shots when certain highlighted elements are comparable or analogous (metaphorical match). <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_match_cut.png" src="Images/visual_match_cut_en.png" width="100" /></p>
