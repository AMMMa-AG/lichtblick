	<body><strong>cinematography:</strong> Cinematography (derived from Greek and meaning roughly “writing in movement”) is a very important part in the making of a film. Although cinematography is a unique art form in itself which is inseparably connected with filmmaking, it also nevertheless shares many similarities with the art of photography. In both domains, the person in charge of the camerawork has to take care of such aspects as the choice of an adequate film material, <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a> of the scene, filters to influence light and colours, <a href="lex_lens_type_en.html">lens type</a>, <a href="lex_focus_en.html">focus</a> settings and the <a href="lex_framing_en.html">framing</a> of the objects and subjects (all the while also considering <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a>, <a href="lex_camera_angle_en.html">camera angle</a> and <a href="lex_composition_en.html">composition</a>). Nevertheless, in the field of cinematography, it is also generally useful to distinguish the cinematographer or director of photography from the camera operator, who simply operates the camera, although sometimes the director of photography and camera operator may be the same person (e.g. Claude Lelouch in <span><em>A Man and a Woman</em></span> and Nicolas Roeg in <span><em>Walkabout</em></span>).<br />
