	<body><strong>extreme long shot:</strong> A person or an object, if not covered over, is shown very small against the panorama of its surrounding. The setting or landscape is thus the main subject. This kind of shot is often used to introduce a scene (<a href="lex_establishing_shot_en.html">establishing shot</a>) or as a transition between two scenes. For related information, read the entry concerning <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a>.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_els.png" src="Images/visual_els_en.png" width="100" /></p>
