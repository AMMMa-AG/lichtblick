	<body><strong>lighting:</strong> Lighting is the intentional use of light to achieve certain aesthetic and/or practical effects. A distinction is made between light sources located within the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en scène</a> as decorative objects (<a href="lex_available_light_en.html">available light</a>) and additional light sources (<a href="lex_exterior_light_en.html">exterior light</a>) which reinforce available light sources to ensure better control over lighting conditions. Lighting is also of particular importance for the creation of moods, adding further layers of meaning and for highlighting elements of the filmic space. In addition, the use of light and shade often acts as a graphic element itself or sometimes functions as a motion <a href="lex_vector_en.html">vector</a> to create a harmonic or disharmonic impression or to direct the audience’s attention.
