	<body><strong>insert (shot):</strong> A shot of part of a scene as filmed from a different position, <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a>, <a href="lex_camera_angle_en.html">camera angle</a> or <a href="lex_camera_height_en.html">height</a> and/or <a href="lex_focal_length_en.html">focal length</a> from the <a href="lex_master_shot_en.html">master shot</a>. Inserts cover action already covered in the master shot, but emphasize a different aspect of that action due to the different <a href="lex_framing_en.html">framing</a>. This kind of shot points out some important detail in a scene that must be given the camera's full attention for a moment. An insert is different from a <a href="lex_cutaway_en.html">cutaway</a> in that the cutaway is of action not covered in the master shot. </body>
