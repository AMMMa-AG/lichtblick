	<body><strong>directionality:</strong> Given that every object within the frame that is not static has a certain directional property, directionality is obviously a very important element within the language of visual design, which often has a dramatic value in itself or carries a certain message. Directionality describes movements of subjects or objects (or the camera itself) within the frame and can be implemented in accordance with the different axes and <a href="lex_vector_en.html">vectors</a> within a <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a> such as<br />
		<ul>
			<li>vertical directions,</li>
			<li>horizontal directions,</li>
			<li>diagonal directions or</li>
			<li>directions along the z-axis.</li>
		</ul>
