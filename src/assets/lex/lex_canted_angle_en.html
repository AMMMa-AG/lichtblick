	<body><strong>canted angle (oblique angle, Dutch angle):</strong> A shot with the camera tilted laterally (see also <a href="lex_rotate_en.html">rotate</a>) that generates a sloping horizon line and transforms formerly horizontal and vertical lines into diagonals. Put more simply, this means that a canted angle creates a view in which the frame is not level. First and foremost, canted angles distort the perspective and thereby often create an effect of confusion because the appearance of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en scène</a> contradicts with the audience’s expectation. This, in turn, often gives the impression of a loss of control and a sense of imbalance. This unpleasant departure from the norm may be the reason that it is also usual to call the canted angle a Dutch angle (in line with other expressions in English of this type that are similarly negative, e.g. Dutch courage, to go Dutch, etc.).
