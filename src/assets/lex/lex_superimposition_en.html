	<body><strong>superimposition:</strong> An <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a> technique and <a href="lex_special_effect_en.html">special effect</a> that blends two or more shots (of separately photographed action) on the same film strip in such a way that the images are seen simultaneously. The technique of superimposition always draws attention to itself since it breaks up the apparent <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">continuity</a> of time and space. During a <a href="lex_lap_dissolve_en.html">lap dissolve</a>, one image is momentarily superimposed on another. In contrast, however, a superimposition usually lasts longer than the blending of two shots in a lap dissolve, and unlike a lap dissolve, usually does not signify a <a href="lex_transitions_en.html">transition</a> from one <a href="lex_scene_en.html">scene</a> to another. Superimpositions are frequently used in <a href="lex_montage_en.html">montage sequences</a>. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_superimposition.png" src="Images/visual_superimposition_en.png" width="100" /></p>
