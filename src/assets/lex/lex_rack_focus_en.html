	<body><strong>rack focus:</strong> Rack focus or <em>racking focus</em> refers to the practice of changing the focus of a lens during a shot in such a way that an element in one plane of the image goes <a href="lex_out_of_focus_en.html">out of focus</a> and an element on another plane in the image comes into focus, thus making a visual connection between those elements. In many cases, rack focus suggests a kind of cause-effect relationship. A further advantage of rack focus is that it makes it possible to direct the viewerâ€™s attention within a shot without the need for <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a>.<br />
