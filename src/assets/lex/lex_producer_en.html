	<body><strong>producer:</strong> A person who selects a <a href="lex_screenplay_en.html">screenplay</a> and initiates the process of making a film. The producer is primarily responsible for the financial and administrative aspects of making the film but generally oversees the whole process, including various supervising and controlling tasks, such as fund-raising, hiring key personnel (e.g. <a href="lex_director_en.html">film director</a>, <a href="lex_cinematographer_en.html">cinematographer</a>), and later arranging the filmâ€™s distribution. A producer's level of creative control on a film project can, however, vary greatly.</body>
