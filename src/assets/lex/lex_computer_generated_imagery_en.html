	<body><strong>computer-generated imagery (CGI):</strong> This is the application of computer-rendered graphics to special effects in films and television programs. Often, only a part of the frame is created via CGI (e.g. the background setting for astronauts floating in space); in other cases, the whole frame is computer generated. There are various reasons for using CGI visual effects. These include the fact that <ul>
			<li>computer-generated effects are easier to adjust and control than other more physically-based processes (e.g. crowd scenes) and real <a href="lex_location_en.html">locations</a>,</li>
			<li>CGI allows the creation of images that would not be possible using analogue technology,</li>
			<li>CGI allows a single graphic artist or small team to produce the desired content without the use of <a href="lex_actor_acting_en.html">actors</a>, expensive <a href="lex_set_en.html">sets</a>, or <a href="lex_prop_en.html">props</a>.</li>
