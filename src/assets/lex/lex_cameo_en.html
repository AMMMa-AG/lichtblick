	<body><strong>cameo:</strong> A cameo appearance (or just cameo) is a brief appearance of a well-known person in a film. These roles are generally small, many of them even non-speaking parts. Sometimes a famous celebrity plays him or herself as part of the storyline of the film. Film directors also often appear in cameo roles to add a kind of personal “signature” to a film. Especially the director Alfred Hitchcock often enjoyed slipping himself in as a casual by-stander or pedestrian in scenes of his films. In fact, it is largely his infamous appearances that popularized the term among general audiences. Such truly brief and somewhat surprising cameo appearances are generally not mentioned in the credits of a film.</body>
