	<body><strong>nonrealistic setting:</strong> The term “nonrealism” is related to the representation of objects and conditions that have no reference to concrete objects or specific examples in reality. In line with this, a nonrealistic setting is the representation of living places or spaces that cannot be found in reality, whether present or past. Often such nonrealistic settings are shot in artificial <a href="lex_realistic_setting_en.html">shooting locations</a> or <a href="lex_set_en.html"><strong>sets</strong></a>. For example, a fairytale film including enchanted forests or caves and a witch’s cottage may be built specially for a film shooting.
