	<body><strong>30-degree system:</strong> Classical Hollywood editing typically adheres to the 30-degree rule, which holds that the camera must move at least 30-degrees between consecutive shots to avoid disconcerting or confusing the viewer. In other words, following this system, it is taboo to show one shot and then cut to another shot that is almost the same as the first. Nevertheless, <a href="lex_jump_cut_en.html">jump cuts</a> deliberately violate this rule since they interrupt a continuous action.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_30.png" src="Images/visual_30_en.png" width="100" />Â <img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_non_30.png" src="Images/visual_non_30_en.png" width="100" /></p>
