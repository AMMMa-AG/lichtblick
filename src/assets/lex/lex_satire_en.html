	<body><strong>satire (film):</strong> Satire is a film genre in which the vices, foolishness, abuses, and shortcomings of people are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming particular individuals, and often also society itself, into improvement. In trying to reach these goals, satirists make use of various expressive devices, such as exaggeration, juxtaposition, analogy, sarcasm and irony. A film does not have to be entirely satirical; it may have only sporadic satirical touches.</body>
