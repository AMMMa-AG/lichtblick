	<body><strong>180-degree system:</strong> The 180° system (or 180° rule) is a key element of the <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">continuity system</a>. In accordance with this rule, the camera must stay in one of the areas on either side of the <a href="lex_axis_of_action_en.html">axis of action</a>, also known as the 180° line. The axis is an imaginary line drawn between the two major dramatic elements in a scene, which are usually, but not necessarily, two characters. The camera can shoot from any position within the area on one side of the line, but it should ideally never cross it, since this is typically disorienting and puzzling for the audience. Despite this, there are nevertheless many examples for the deliberate violation of the 180° rule for expressive reasons. <p align="center"><img lw-src="../bilder/lex_180_01.jpg" src="Images/lex_180_01_en.jpg" /><br />
