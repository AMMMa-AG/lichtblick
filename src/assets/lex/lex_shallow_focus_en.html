	<body><strong>shallow focus (selsctive focus):</strong><br />A restricted <a href="lex_depth_of_field_en.html">depth of field</a>, in which only one depth plane is in sharp focus, while objects in the background or close to the camera are <a href="lex_out_of_focus_en.html">out of focus</a>, and thus blurry (see <a href="lex_bokeh_en.html">bokeh</a>). The technique is typically used to direct the viewerâ€™s attention to the objects in the plane that is in sharp focus. In addition, shallow focus is frequently used for <a href="lex_close_up_en.html">close-ups</a> suggesting psychological introspection, since a character thus appears to be oblivious to the world around him. The opposite of shallow focus is <a href="lex_deep_focus_en.html">deep focus</a>. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_shallow_focus.png" src="Images/visual_shallow_focus_en.png" width="100" /></p>
