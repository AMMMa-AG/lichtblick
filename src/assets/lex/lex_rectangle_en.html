	<body><strong>rectangle:</strong> The rectangle is a basic shape that can be used for <a href="lex_composition_en.html">compositional</a> purposes within the frame. Rectangles, and thus also squares, can be implemented as a concrete shape formed by one or more objects of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en sc√®ne</a>. In addition, rectangles can arise from <a href="lex_cast_shadow_en.html">shadows</a> and <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a> effects or even from <a href="lex_line_en.html">lines</a> formed by non-physical connections between several surfaces or objects.<br /> As the right angles of rectangles are not naturally found in nature, this shape is also often associated with civilization or a logical and mathematical setting.<br />Other basic shapes are <a href="lex_line_en.html">lines</a>, <a href="lex_triangle_en.html">triangle</a> and <a href="lex_circle_en.html">circle</a>.<p align="center"><img lw-src="../bilder/shape_rectangle.gif" src="Images/shape_rectangle_en.gif" /></p>
