	<body><strong>desaturated colour:</strong> This refers to colours of less luminosity and vividness. Desaturated colours have a reduced amount of the initial colour (<span>hue</span>) due to the addition of their complementary colour. Complementary colours are colours that face each other on the <a href="lex_colour_wheel_en.html">colour wheel</a>. When mixed with each other, two complementaries reduce each otherâ€™s saturation towards grey; in other words, they desaturate each other. For related information, read the entry concerning <a href="lex_contrast_of_saturation_en.html">contrast of saturation</a>. <br />
