	<body><strong>eyeline match:</strong> A cinematic <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a> practice aimed at ensuring the inherent logic of a look or gaze. An eyeline match basically shows what a character is looking at. Most commonly, they are used when a character looks at something offscreen (<a href="lex_gaze_shot_en.html">gaze shot</a>), and the next shot then shows what is being looked at (typically a <a href="lex_point_of_view_shot_en.html">point-of-view shot</a>). Eyeline matches help to establish and stabilize <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">spatial continuity</a>, as successive shots correspond to the spatial layout of characters and objects established in earlier shots. The corresponding editing practice of the eyeline match also obeys the <a href="lex_180_degree_system_en.html">180Â° rule</a>. A <a href="lex_point_of_view_shot_en.html">point-of-view shot</a> is a special type of eyeline match, in which the audience is shown exactly what a character is seeing. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_eyeline_match.png" src="Images/visual_eyeline_match_en.png" width="100" /></p>
