	<body><strong>omniscient camera:</strong> A concept in which the camera (as the visual narrator) has an omniscient <a href="lex_point_of_view_en.html">point of view</a> and thus “knows” (and sees) everything occurring in a story, including character thoughts, as well as all actions, places, conversations and events. An omniscient camera often “anticipates” what is going to happen by making changes in <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a>, <a href="lex_camera_angle_en.html">camera angle</a>, <a href="lex_camera_movement_en.html">camera movement</a> or <a href="lex_focus_en.html">focus</a> adjustment. The omniscient point of view stands in contrast to the subjective point of view.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_omniscient_camera.png" src="Images/visual_omniscient_camera_en.png" width="100" /></p>
