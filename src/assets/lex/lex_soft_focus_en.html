	<body><strong>soft focus:</strong> An optical effect created by the use of a special lens or filter, which produces images that are deliberately blurred due to spherical aberration while retaining sharp edges. In this respect, it is thus not the same as an <a href="lex_out_of_focus_en.html">out of focus</a> image, since the effect cannot be achieved simply by defocusing a sharp lens. Soft focus is also the name of the style of photography produced by such a lens. Soft focus adds a touch of softness to the image, which is generally associated with “romantic moods”. </body>
