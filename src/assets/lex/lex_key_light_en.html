	<body><strong>key light:</strong> The key light is the brightest and the first light set in each <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shot</a> and is the main part of the basic <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a> arrangement known as <a href="lex_three_point_lighting_en.html">three-point lighting</a>. The key light is the most directional of the three lights, and as such, strongly directs the viewerâ€™s attention. When used on its own, it also casts the strongest shadows.
