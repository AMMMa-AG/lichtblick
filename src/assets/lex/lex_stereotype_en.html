	<body><strong>stereotype:</strong> A generalizing mental representation of a social or cultural group that is characterized by partly exaggerated caricaturing or sometimes wrong attributions of personality traits and behaviours that are particularly striking. As opposed to prejudices, stereotypes do not necessarily have negative connotations, but reduce complexity and offer identification possibilities. </body>
