	<body><strong>proxemic patterns:</strong> The term “proxemic patterns” refers to the distribution and relationship of people in a given space. The underlying concept of proxemic patterns was developed by anthropologist Edward T. Hall, who distinguished the following four major proxemic patterns: <br /><strong>1. the intimate, 2. the personal, 3. the social, 4. the public distance.</strong><br />
		<br />a) In the context of film analysis, some film scholars have adopted this concept and related it to the various <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distances</a>: <ol start="" type="">
			<li>intimate distance → distance of physical involvement, reserved for lovers and members of family ~ <a href="lex_extreme_close_up_en.html">ECU</a>, <a href="lex_close_up_en.html">CU</a></li>
			<li>personal distance → arm's length away, reserved for friends rather than lovers and family members ~ <a href="lex_medium_close_up_en.html">MCU</a>, <a href="lex_medium_shot_en.html">MS</a>, <a href="lex_medium_long_shot_en.html">MLS</a></li>
			<li>social distance → impersonal business and casual relationships ~ <a href="lex_long_shot_en.html">LS</a></li>
			<li>public distance → formal and rather detached ~ <a href="lex_extreme_long_shot_en.html">ELS</a></li>
		</ol>
		<br /> Admittedly, a shot labelled with a certain <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a> does not always equate to the same literal physical space between the camera and the subject; in psychological terms, these shots tend to suggest the corresponding physical distances, their effect is the same, regardless of the actual real camera distance. <br />
		<br />b) Furthermore, the concept of proxemic patterns is not only applied to the distance between a character and the camera but also to the distance between characters. The later kind of use tries to conclude from the distance between two (or more) characters on their relationship. <br /><video controls="true" src="Images/distance.mp4" width="100%"></video></body>
