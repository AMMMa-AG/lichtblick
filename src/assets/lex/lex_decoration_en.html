	<body><strong>decoration:</strong> Refers to the visual design of the <a href="lex_setting_en.html">setting</a> in which a story takes place. Furnishings, as well as wallpaper and many smaller objects, such as photos, pillows, bunches of flowers, blinds, lamps and bottles or cans placed within the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en scène</a> all belong to the decoration. The visual design of a setting may reveal a lot about the time and space of the story and a particular character’s personality. For example, large settings with a lot of decorative objects may reveal that the characters are wealthy, while dirty and narrow streets are typical of poorer districts.
