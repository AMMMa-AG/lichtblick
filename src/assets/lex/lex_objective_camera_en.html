	<body><strong>objective camera:</strong> An objective camera is one that tries to avoid attracting the viewer’s attention to itself and aims to give an objective view of the action. An objective camera often remains still (see <a href="lex_static_en.html">static shot</a>) and shows characters from a certain distance in order not to manipulate the viewer’s perception of the scene. For this reason, the viewer does not get the impression of directly participating in the action.<br /> The objective camera in filmmaking corresponds with the third-person narrator in literature. Opposite of <a href="lex_subjective_camera_en.html">subjective camera</a>. <br />
