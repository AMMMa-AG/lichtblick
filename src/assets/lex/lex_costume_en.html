	<body><strong>costume:</strong> A costume includes all items of clothing and accessories that a character wears during a film. Costumes are the main vehicle for depicting a characterâ€™s personality and status visually. By playing with <a href="lex_stereotype_en.html">stereotypes</a> or symbolic accessories, costume designers can establish the relationships of characters to their surroundings or to other subjects by creating and emphasizing contrasts and commonalities. </body>
