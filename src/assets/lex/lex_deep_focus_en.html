	<body><strong>deep focus:</strong> A cinematic <a href="lex_style_en.html">style</a> in which several significant elements of an image are positioned at various points both near to and distant from the camera. Deep focus requires that these elements placed along very different depth planes of the image (i.e. foreground, middle ground and background) all be <a href="lex_focus_en.html">in focus</a> at the same time, thus giving the audience a choice about what to look at rather than limiting their attention to particular focused elements. A relatively large <a href="lex_depth_of_field_en.html">depth of field</a> is one of the technical conditions for deep focus, which can be achieved by the use of <a href="lex_wide_angle_lens_en.html">wide-angle lenses</a>. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_deep_focus.png" src="Images/visual_deep_focus_en.png" width="100" /></p>
