	<body><strong>shot/reverse shot:</strong> An <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a> pattern that <a href="lex_cut_en.html">cuts</a> between characters (or other objects) in alternation; often used in dialogue scenes. The second shot is taken from the reverse angle of the first shot (and so on). The shot/reverse shot pattern is fundamental to the <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">continuity editing</a> style. Some filmmakers prefer to use a <a href="lex_two_shot_en.html">“two shot”</a> (this is shot showing two individuals simultaneously) in dialogue scenes, rather than dissecting the space into several “one shots” that are connected in the shot/reverse shot pattern. The shot/reverse shot pattern is often used in combination with <a href="lex_over_the_shoulder_shot_en.html">over-the-shoulder shots</a>.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_shot_reverse_shot.png" src="Images/visual_shot_reverse_shot_en.png" width="100" /></p>
