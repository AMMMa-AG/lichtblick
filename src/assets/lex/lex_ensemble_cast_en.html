	<body><strong>ensemble cast: </strong> A film with a group of actors whose roles are of equal importance for the overall story of the film. Films with an ensemble cast break with the convention of <a href="lex_classical_Hollywood_cinema_en.html">classical Hollywood cinema</a>, according to which one single heroic character or protagonist is put in the centre of the action. For this reason, ensemble cast films can often be found in the category of <a href="lex_independent_film_en.html">independent films</a>. Many TV-series also use ensemble casts, as this gives them the freedom to change the storyline and the character that the respective episode focuses on, thus making the production more varied and interesting to the viewer. </body>
