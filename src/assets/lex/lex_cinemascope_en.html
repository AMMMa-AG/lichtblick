	<body><strong>CinemaScope:</strong> A process related to the wide-screen, in which a lens on the camera squeezes and distorts a wide-screen image onto standard film material. Later, when the film is shown in the cinema, another corresponding lens on the projector unsqueezes the image to its normal shape and to a ratio of 2.35:1. Ultra-Panavision 70 with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1 is another example of an anamorphic format using special lenses on the camera and the projector. </body>
