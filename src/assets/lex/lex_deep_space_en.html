	<body><strong>deep space (deep staging):</strong> A cinematic style in which several significant elements of an image are positioned at various points both near to and distant from the camera. This means that the characters in the shot have a large spatial scope so that they sometimes even seem to disappear within the wide area. Deep space can be achieved by establishing a very long z-axis that opens the available stage. More often than not, deep space is combined with <a href="lex_deep_focus_en.html">deep focus</a>, which requires that elements placed along very different depth planes of the image (i.e. foreground, middle ground and background) be in <a href="lex_focus_en.html">focus</a> at the same time. However, for deep staging, these objects do not necessarily have to be in focus. Staging in deep space is the opposite of staging in <a href="lex_flat_space_en.html">flat space</a>. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_deep_space.png" src="Images/visual_deep_space_en.png" width="100" /></p>
