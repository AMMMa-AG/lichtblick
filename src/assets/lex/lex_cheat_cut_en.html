	<body><strong>cheat cut:</strong> A cheat cut is a transition between two <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shots</a>, in which the second shot is filmed from a camera position that should actually be impossible given the positions of the figures and objects from the previous shot, which thus leads to a mismatch. For example, a cheat cut might switch to a camera position, where in the previous shot it seemed there was a solid wall. Obviously, cheat cuts can be more easily implemented when the filming takes place at a <a href="lex_set_en.html">studio set</a> instead of outdoor <a href="lex_location_en.html">locations</a>, since in studios, supposedly solid objects like walls can easily be moved out of the way. </body>
