	<body><strong>low angle:</strong> A shot taken from below a characterâ€™s eye-level or more or less below the action. This perspective from below creates optical distortions of the subject that makes the lower parts of it appear larger and its upper parts smaller and shorter. The relative weighting of the subject is increased in comparison with its background and it seems to tower above the lens, which is why it can have a menacing impact on the audience. The closer the camera is positioned to a character (see <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a>), the more the audience is forced to identify with the character because facial expressions appear more dramatic from a lower viewpoint.
