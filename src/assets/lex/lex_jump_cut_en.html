	<body><strong>jump cut:</strong> A jump cut is a type of <a href="lex_transitions_en.html">transition</a> between two shots, showing the same content taken from the same or a just slightly varied camera position in which some content seems to be missing. If the angle of <a href="lex_framing_en.html">framing</a> of two consecutive shots is too similar (see <a href="lex_30_degree_system_en.html">30 degree rule</a>), it gives the impression that an object is jumping from one position to another.<br /> In actual fact, a jump cut simply interrupts a continuous action at a certain moment and then starts again seamlessly, albeit after an amount of time has elapsed. As the second shot is discontinuous to the first shot, however, the viewer has the feeling that some of the action has been dropped. The jump cut is a special form of <a href="lex_elliptical_editing_en.html">elliptical editing</a>, with only a very short time span missing.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_jump_cut.png" src="Images/visual_jump_cut_en.png" width="100" /></p>
