	<body><strong>triangle:</strong> The triangle is a basic shape that can be used for compositional aspects within the frame. Triangles can be implemented as a concrete shape formed by one or more objects of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en sc√®ne</a>. In addition, however, triangles can arise from <a href="lex_cast_shadow_en.html">shadows</a> and <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a> effects or even from lines formed by non-physical connections between several faces or objects. <br /> Triangles and triadic <a href="lex_composition_en.html">compositions</a> are often used to stress the relationship and dynamic interplay between three main elements (typically characters).<br />Other basic shapes are <a href="lex_line_en.html">lines</a>, the <a href="lex_rectangle_en.html">rectangle</a> and the <a href="lex_circle_en.html">circle</a>.<p align="center"><img lw-src="../bilder/shape_triangle.gif" src="Images/shape_triangle_en.gif" /></p>
