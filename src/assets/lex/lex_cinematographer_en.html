	<body><strong>cinematographer:</strong> The person who is responsible for the camerawork and the <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a> settings. In general, the title is synonymous with the title director of photography (DP), which is used to designate the head of the camera and lighting crews working on a film set. The director of photography works closely with the film director and is jointly responsible for achieving various artistic and technical aims in relation to the film. For more related information, see entry on <a href="lex_cinematography_en.html">cinematography</a>.<br /> It is also useful to distinguish the cinematographer or director of photography from the general camera operator, who simply operates the camera, although sometimes the director of photography and camera operator may be the same person (e.g. Claude Lelouch in <span><em>A Man and a Woman</em></span> and Nicolas Roeg in <span><em>Walkabout</em></span>).<br />
