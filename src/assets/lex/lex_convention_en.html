	<body><strong>convention:</strong> A set of generally-agreed, explicitly-stipulated or widely-accepted standards, methods, techniques, practices or criteria, often taking the form of a tradition or a kind of commandment (see quote below). In film, filmmakers and audiences have grown to accept certain techniques and practices as natural or typical in certain contexts. For example, in most films a <a href="lex_point_of_view_shot_en.html">point-of-view shot</a> of someone looking through a set of binoculars is represented visually by <span>masking</span> the picture with two inverted overlapping circles. In reality, however, one would only see a single circle when looking through properly-aligned binoculars.<br />
		<br />Another very basic convention associated with filmmaking is the system of <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a>, with its <a href="lex_cut_en.html">cuts</a> and various <a href="lex_transitions_en.html">transitions</a>. This system is generally accepted as logical, even though, given that the viewer’s perception of reality is actually continuous, it is highly unnatural. Nevertheless, there are several conventions of <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">continuity editing</a> which help to create the impression of film as an ongoing action without interruptions, despite the many cuts and transitions.<br />
		<br /> The following quote from Gregg Toland, the cinematographer for <span><em>Citizen Kane</em></span>, throws some light on the significance of conventions in filmmaking:<br /><em>“Right away I want to make a distinction between 'commandment' and 'convention'. Photographically speaking, I understand a commandment to be a rule, axiom, or principle, an incontrovertible fact of photographic procedure which is unchangeable for physical and chemical reasons. On the other hand, a convention, to me, is a usage which has become acceptable through repetition. It is a tradition rather than a rule. With time the convention becomes a commandment, through force of habit. I feel that the limiting effect is both obvious and unfortunate.”</em></body>
