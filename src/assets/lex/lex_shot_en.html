	<body><strong>shot:</strong> (1) A piece of film that has been exposed without <a href="lex_cut_en.html">cuts</a> or interruptions (before <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a>).<br />
		<br /> (2) A trimmed piece of uninterrupted film which is used in the <a href="lex_final_cut_en.html">final version</a> of a film (after <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a>). <br />
		<br />In both cases, the shot is the basic element of a film, defined by its physical (including digital) existence as an unbroken entity (or its appearance as such for the viewers). A shot may be of any duration, from a fraction of a second to minutes and even hours. A lengthy shot with a duration of more than approximately 40 seconds is called a <a href="lex_long_take_en.html">long take</a>.</body>
