	<body><strong>out of focus:</strong> Opposite of being “in <a href="lex_focus_en.html">focus</a>”. If something is not in focus it does not appear sharp and clear. On the contrary, it appears blurred and indistinctive. This area is also known as <a href="lex_bokeh_en.html">bokeh</a>. The technique of using <a href="lex_shallow_focus_en.html">shallow focus</a> often generates large areas which are out of focus. Often out of focus shots may also be used to simulate the effects of restricted or altered perception, e.g. the loss of consciousness or the effects of a psychedelic drug. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_out_of_focus.png" src="Images/visual_out_of_focus_en.png" width="100" /></p>
