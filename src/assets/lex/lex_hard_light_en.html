	<body><strong>hard light:</strong> The term “hard” refers to the quality of the light. A hard light quality creates harsh borders (as if drawn with a ruler) between lit and shady areas. Overall, it produces a bright illumination and thus reveals many details. For this reason, people tend to look rather unflattering and less attractive because this bright and harsh light accents wrinkles and imperfections of the skin.
