	<body><strong>flashback:</strong> A shot or a series of shots that break normal chronological order by shifting directly to an event representing the past. Flashbacks are jumps in <a href="lex_diegetic_en.html">diegetic</a> time. They may be subjective (showing the thoughts and memory of a character, see <a href="lex_mind_screen_en.html">mindscreen</a>) or objective (returning to earlier events to show their relationship to the present). Flashbacks may often make up almost the entire film (e.g. a character tells his life story in a flashback). Usually, the beginning of a flashback is clearly marked with various stylistic devices such as, <a href="lex_lap_dissolve_en.html">dissolves</a>, <a href="lex_fade_out_fade_in_en.html">fades</a> and <a href="lex_superimposition_en.html">superimpositions</a>. A larger pattern of cutting back and forth between the present time in film, flashbacks and flash-forwards may be used in <a href="lex_parallel_editing_en.html">parallel editing</a>. The opposite of a flashback, the jump to future events, is called <a href="lex_flash_forward_en.html">flash-forward</a>. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_flashback.png" src="Images/visual_flashback_en.png" width="100" /></p>
