	<body><strong>point-of-view shot (POV):</strong> A shot taken with the camera placed approximately where at least one of the character’s eyes would be, with the effect that the viewers temporarily share the assumed view of a character or group. This kind of shot is generally used to encourage, or sometimes even to force, the viewers to identify emotionally or intellectually with a character.<br />
		<br /> A POV shot is actually accomplished through a combination of <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shots</a>, which are usually <a href="lex_cut_en.html">cut</a> in before or after a shot of the character looking in a particular direction. In this respect, it can be seen that POV cutting is a type of <a href="lex_eyeline_match_en.html">eyeline match</a>. Nevertheless, while eyeline matches and POV shots are similar in both showing the film viewer the object of the character’s gaze, a POV cut differs from an eyeline match in showing the object strictly from the perspective of the character; eyeline matches, in contrast, can show more space around the object and can also be shot from a slightly different angle.<br />
		<br />In the case of a POV shot in which the camera is moving, it is very important that the <a href="lex_camera_movement_en.html">camera movement</a> matches the natural movement of the relevant character, e.g. imagine a POV shot of a running dog.<br />
		<br />Further cinematographic aspects that have to be carefully matched in order to achieve plausible point-of-view shots are <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a> and <a href="lex_camera_angle_en.html">camera angle</a>. <p align="center"><img lw-src="../bilder/lex_point_of_view_shot.jpg" src="Images/lex_point_of_view_shot_en.jpg" /><br /> Simplified scheme of the objective and subjective camera and the point-of-view shot <br />
