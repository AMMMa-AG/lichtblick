	<body><strong>cutaway (shot):</strong> A brief shot that interrupts the action by briefly inserting another related action, object, or person, followed by a cutback to the original shot (or a slightly different shot showing of the same subject, object or scene). Cutaways show action not covered by the <a href="lex_master_shot_en.html">master shot</a>. Cutaways are often used in a sequence to hide discontinuity, to emphasize something or to show simultaneous events. However, cutaways may also serve purely aesthetical aims. <a href="lex_reaction_shot_en.html">Reaction shots</a> are also usually cutaways. See also <a href="lex_insert_en.html">insert</a>.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_cutaway_shot.png" src="Images/visual_cutaway_shot_en.png" width="100" /></p>
