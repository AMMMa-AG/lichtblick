	<body><strong>long take:</strong> A long take is, first and foremost, a <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shot</a> of long duration. The term should not be confused with “<a href="lex_take_en.html">take</a>”, which is one of the many recordings of a given shot, or the term “<a href="lex_long_shot_en.html">long shot</a>”, which is a shot taken from a specific <a href="lex_camera_distance_en.html">camera distance</a>. <br /> A long take is, by definition, uninterrupted (see <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shot</a>) and lasts much longer than is conventional, either for the editing <a href="lex_pace_en.html">pace</a> of the film itself or of films in general. The <a href="lex_average_shot_length_en.html">average shot length</a> (ASL) of classical Hollywood films is about 9 seconds, and most contemporary films (particularly those of the action <a href="lex_genre_en.html">genre</a>) tend to have faster editing rates and thus a significantly lower ASL, so in general, any shot above 40 seconds can clearly be considered a long take. <br />
		<br />Long takes can be used for dramatic and narrative effect as an alternative to a series of shots or even a complete <a href="lex_scene_en.html">scene</a>, but typically require a great deal of planning and organization. When an entire scene is rendered in one single shot, this long take is called a <a href="lex_sequence_shot_en.html">sequence shot</a>. Given that the duration of a shot and the filmed events usually seem to be roughly equal, a long take can have the advantage of appearing to be more <a href="lex_realism_en.html">realistic</a> and <a href="lex_documentary_en.html">documentary</a>-style than an <a href="lex_editing_en.html">edited</a> scene composed of several short shots. <br />
		<br />The long take, usually in combination with complex <a href="lex_camera_movement_en.html">camera movement</a>, <a href="lex_deep_focus_en.html">deep focus</a> and <a href="lex_deep_space_en.html">deep space</a> has become part of the signature style of many well-known directors (including Orson Welles, Paul Thomas Anderson, Robert Altman and Martin Scorsese). <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_long_take.png" src="Images/visual_long_take_en.png" width="100" /></p>
