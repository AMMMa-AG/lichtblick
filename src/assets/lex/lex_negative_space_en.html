	<body><strong>negative space:</strong> Parts of the frame or an area within the frame that are/is left blank or in which objects are missing in a way that is striking. By leaving part(s) of the frame empty, other areas of the screen can be emphasized, so in this respect, even negative space has a certain weight and importance in the <a href="lex_composition_en.html">composition</a> of a frame.<br /> The opposite of negative space is <a href="lex_positive_space_en.html">positive space</a>.</body>
