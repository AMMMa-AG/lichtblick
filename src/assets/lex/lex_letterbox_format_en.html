	<body><strong>letterbox format:</strong> Technical method that adjusts the width of a film with a widescreen <a href="lex_aspect_ratio_en.html">aspect ratio</a> in order to be able to show it on a narrower screen by shrinking it to the width of the replay screen. The original aspect ratio of the material is preserved at the cost of a reduced replay size and characteristic black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. An alternative method is <a href="lex_pan_and_scan_en.html">pan and scan</a>.</body>
