	<body><strong>trailer:</strong> A trailer is a brief compilation of highlights from an upcoming feature film made for advertising purposes. Originally, trailers were shown at the end of a feature film screening (hence the name “trailer”), but nowadays, they are typically shown before the feature film. Trailers try to tell the story of a feature film in a highly condensed fashion (usually in a <a href="lex_fast_cutting_en.html">fast cutting</a> style) that must have maximum appeal to the intended audience. For this reason, trailers generally concentrate on the most exciting, visually spectacular and/or funniest shots of the film without producing spoilers (i.e. elements that give away too much about the plot). </body>
