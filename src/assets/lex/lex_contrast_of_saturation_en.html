	<body><strong>contrast of saturation:</strong> The contrast between colours of a high <a href="lex_saturated_colour_en.html">saturation</a> (or in more precise terms of a pure <a href="lex_hue_en.html">hue</a> with strong luminosity, see <a href="lex_saturated_colour_en.html">saturated colour</a>) and <a href="lex_desaturated_colour_en.html">desaturated colours</a> with less luminosity, is one that is popularly used in filmmaking. Recall that desaturation is achieved by adding the complementary colour to a pure hue of high luminosity or saturation. Often, a background is designed in desaturated, and therefore unobtrusive colours, while essential objects are set off from that background through the use of striking strong colours. In this way, the signal effect that colours of pure hue already have in themselves can be additionally strengthened. <br />
