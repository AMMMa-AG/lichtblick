	<body><strong>art house film:</strong> An art house film (also called “art cinema”, “art movie”) is typically a serious, non-commercial, independently-made film which generally challenges accepted conventions of mainstream cinema. In the United States, foreign language films that share some of these qualities, are frequently referred to as art house films, even though they may have been produced by a major company in the film’s country of origin and may even have achieved popular commercial success in that region. In general, however, art house films are aimed at a niche audience, rather than a mass audience. </body>
