	<body><strong>light-dark contrast:</strong> The <a href="lex_colour_brightness_en.html">brightness</a> of a colour can be changed by adding black or white. Adding black is referred to as <strong>shading</strong> a colour, while admixing white is termed <strong>tinting</strong> a colour. Light-dark contrasts affect both the contrast between different shades and tints of one colour (in this case is referred to as <a href="lex_monochromacy_en.html">monochromatic</a> design), as well as the contrast between different pure <a href="lex_hue_en.html">hues</a> which differ in their subjective brightness, such as the primaries yellow and blue. In any image, it is always the brightest colour which is the first to attract the viewerâ€™s attention. <br />
