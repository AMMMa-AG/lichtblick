	<body><strong>Cinéma Vérité:</strong> Cinéma Vérité (French for “truthful cinema”) is a form of typically documentary-style filmmaking, combining naturalistic techniques with stylized cinematic devices of <a href="lex_editing_en.html">editing</a> and <a href="lex_cinematography_en.html">cinematography</a> which was developed in France in the 1960s. The Cinéma Vérité filmmakers made use of newly-developed, unobtrusive lightweight equipment for filming on <a href="lex_location_en.html">location</a>, and often tried to deliberately provoke the people they filmed by placing them in crisis situations to get at the truth that they felt was hidden under the surface. A similar movement arose in the United States at approximately the same time under the label of <a href="lex_direct_cinema_en.html">Direct Cinema</a>. However, the direct cinema makers took more of a “fly on the wall”-observer approach to allow the truth to reveal itself. Aspects of Cinéma Vérité and direct cinema also later influenced the work of fictional filmmakers.</body>
