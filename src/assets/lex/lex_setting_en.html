	<body><strong>setting:</strong> Setting refers to the time and space where the action of a film takes place. The setting of a film can differ from the <a href="lex_shooting_location_en.html">shooting location</a>, i.e. the physical place where the filming of the action takes place. A distinction is made between shooting locations that are built specially for film shooting – this type is called a <a href="lex_set_en.html">set</a> – and real <a href="lex_location_en.html">locations</a> that are only changed slightly. Equipment and <a href="lex_decoration_en.html">decoration</a> of the shooting location can reveal a lot about the setting, or in other words, the time and space of the story. As a rule, both the setting and the appearance of the characters are designed to match each other. Further aspects may be discovered by looking for contrasts or exaggerated uniformity.
