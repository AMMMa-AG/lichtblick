	<body><strong>following shot:</strong> A shot in which the camera itself follows behind or alongside a moving subject and thus actually accompanies the movement of the subject during the shot. The following movement can be achieved by <a href="lex_track_en.html">tracking</a>, <a href="lex_dolly_en.html">dollying</a> or shooting with a <a href="lex_handheld_en.html">handheld</a> camera, although in many cases, a <a href="lex_steadicam_en.html">Steadicam</a> is the most practical option. In such shots, the following distance is usually kept more or less constant.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_follow_shot.png" src="Images/visual_follow_shot_en.png" width="100" /></p>
