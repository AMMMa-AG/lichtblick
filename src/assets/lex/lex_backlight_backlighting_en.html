	<body><strong>backlight or rimlight:</strong> The backlight (also called rimlight) is one part of the basic lighting arrangement known as three-point lighting. It is placed behind the subject opposite the camera, though high above it, so that none of the light glares directly into the camera. Its main function is to help to set the subject off from the background by highlighting the edges of it. A backlight with a comparatively high intensity also creates the particularly striking effect of a halo around the object.
