	<body><strong>dolly:</strong> A hydraulically-powered camera platform on wheels (sometimes also on rails) that allows for smooth and silent movements during filming. A dolly is often used to move toward (= “dolly in”, “move in”, “track in”) or away from (= “dolly out”, “dolly back”, “move out”, “track back”) the action. When the dolly-mounted camera moves alongside the subject, this is called a "tracking within" or "travelling shot". When the dolly moves away from the subject or object, the camera reveals further visual information that was previously out of the <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a> (e.g. other characters). It is important, however, to distinguish dolly in and dolly out shots from <a href="lex_zoom_shot_en.html">zoom shots</a>. <p align="center"><img lw-src="../bilder/lex_fisher_dolly.png" src="Images/lex_fisher_dolly_en.png" /><br />Fisher dolly on a track</p> By Eliot Lash published under Creative commons Attribution 2.5 Generic</body>
