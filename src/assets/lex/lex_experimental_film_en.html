	<body><strong>experimental film (avant-garde):</strong> A range of filmmaking styles that largely reject the <a href="lex_convention_en.html">conventions</a> of mainstream films. Experimental films are often characterized by the absence of linear narrative and the presence of various abstracting techniques (e.g. filming <a href="lex_out_of_focus_en.html">out of focus</a>, painting or scratching on film, <a href="lex_fast_motion_en.html">fast-motion</a> and <a href="lex_slow_motion_en.html">slow-motion</a> editing). The goal is often to put the viewer in a more active and reflective relationship to the film and the medium of film in general. Experimental filmmakers tend to favour <a href="lex_style_en.html">style</a> and form over subject matter as content. <br />
