	<body><strong>closure:</strong> An ending which makes a story largely complete. A film that has closure leaves the viewers with no major unanswered questions regarding the main storyline elements and the characters. A happy ending is a form of closure in which almost everything turns out for the best for the hero or heroine.</body>
