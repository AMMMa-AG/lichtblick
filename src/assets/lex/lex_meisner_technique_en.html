	<body><strong>Meisner technique:</strong> The Meisner technique is an acting technique, which more or less directly contradicts the technique of <a href="lex_method_acting_en.html"> method acting</a>. Starting from the belief that most <a href="lex_actor_acting_en.html">actors</a> approach their roles in a rather top-heavy and overly intellectual way, which may come at the expense of spontaneity and therefore credibility, the technique proposes that the actors should understand the situationâ€™s emotional context in order to <em>react</em> in accordance with the respective action. Actors should thus concentrate their attention on the moment in order to be open for impulses given by the surrounding situation and, above all, for emotional cues offered by their fellow actors.
