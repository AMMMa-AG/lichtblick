	<body><strong class="title">Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth</strong><p>Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all.</p>
		<p> Economic growth should be a positive force for the whole planet. This is why we must make sure that financial progress creates decent and fulfilling jobs while not harming the environment. We must protect labour rights and once and for all put a stop to modern slavery and child labour. If we promote job creation with expanded access to banking and financial services, we can make sure that everybody gets the benefits of entrepreneurship and innovation. </p>
