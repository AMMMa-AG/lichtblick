	<body><strong>lap dissolve:</strong> In this type of transition, the first shot ends with a <a href="lex_fade_out_en.html">fade out</a>, as simultaneously, the second shot <a href="lex_fade_in_en.html">fades in</a>, thus gradually overlapping with the first shot as it fades out. The lap dissolve is thus similar to a <a href="lex_fade_out_fade_in_en.html">fade-out,fade-in</a>, with the main difference being that the middle-sequence of briefly showing a plain-coloured screen is left out so that the end of the first and the beginning of the second shot are briefly superimposed. In <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">continuity editing</a>, lap dissolves are mainly used to flag a temporal discontinuity (i.e. the passage of time).<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_dissolve.png" src="Images/visual_dissolve_en.png" width="100" /></p>
