	<body><strong>slow cutting:</strong> The process of cutting together several shots of long duration. Slow cutting is an effective way to slow down the <a href="lex_pace_en.html">pace</a> of a film. It is often used to express calmness and the absence of action or to convey an introspective atmosphere. Slow cutting usually enables the viewers to explore a shot more carefully. The building blocks of this kind of editing are shots of long duration (particularly <a href="lex_long_take_en.html">long takes</a>).
