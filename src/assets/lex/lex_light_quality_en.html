	<body><strong>light quality:</strong> refers to the relative intensity of light and is most commonly used in connection with the distinction between hard and soft light. Hard light produces harsh borders between lit and shady areas, whereas soft light has a wide scattering and shows a smooth transition from the deepest shadow via partial shade to the bright areas.
