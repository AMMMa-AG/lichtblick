	<body><strong>Dogme 95:</strong> A Danish <a href="lex_film_movement_en.html">film movement</a> and style that was started in 1995 by the Danish directors Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg with the signing of the Dogme 95 Manifesto and the so-called “Vow of Chastity”. Above all, the Dogme directors rejected the expensive filmmaking techniques used in most commercial films (especially those from Hollywood), genre conventions, spectacular special effects and too much editing. Instead, their aim was to place emphasis on the actual story and on the actors’ performances and to strive for more “truthful”, “non-Hollywood” cinematic storytelling.<br />
		<br /> The Dogme 95 rules, which were termed the "Vow of Chastity," are as follows: <ol start="" type="">
			<li>Filming must be done on <a href="lex_location_en.html">location</a>. <a href="lex_prop_en.html">Props</a> and sets must not be brought in. If a particular prop is necessary for the story, a location must be chosen where this prop is to be found.</li>
			<li>The <a href="lex_soundtrack_en.html">sound</a> must never be produced apart from the images or vice versa. Music must not be used unless it occurs within the scene being filmed, i.e. <a href="lex_diegetic_en.html">diegetic</a>.</li>
			<li>The camera must be a <a href="lex_handheld_en.html">handheld camera</a>. Any movement or immobility attainable in the hand is permitted. The film must not take place where the camera is standing; filming must take place where the action takes place.</li>
			<li>The film must be in colour. <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">Special lighting</a> is not acceptable (if there is too little light for exposure, the scene must be cut or a single lamp be attached to the camera).</li>
			<li>Optical work and <a href="lex_filter_en.html">filters</a> are forbidden.</li>
			<li>The film must not contain superficial action (i.e. murders, use of weapons, etc. must not occur).</li>
			<li>Temporal and geographical alienation are forbidden (in other words, the film takes place here and now). <a href="lex_genre_en.html">Genre</a> movies are not acceptable.</li>
			<li>The final picture must be transferred to the Academy 35mm film, with an aspect ratio of 4:3; that is, not widescreen.</li>
			<li>The director must not be credited.</li>
