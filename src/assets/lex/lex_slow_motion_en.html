	<body><strong>slow motion (<em>slomo</em>):</strong> In slow motion, movements on the screen appear slower than they normally would in actual life. For example, a diver will seem to sink gently into the water rather than fall at the speed dictated by gravity. Slow motion can be achieved by shooting at more than the standard 24 frames per second (this process is called overcranking); subsequent projection at 24 frames per second then slows down the action. Slow motion can also be achieved by playing normally-recorded <a href="lex_footage_en.html">footage</a> at a slower speed. Slow motion is widespread in modern filmmaking: it is used by directors to achieve diverse effects, both in drama and in comedy films (e.g. to reduce the <a href="lex_pace_en.html">pace</a> and lengthen the duration of an action, to emotionally charge an event, or to increase the <a href="lex_suspense_en.html">suspense</a> of a scene). The bullet time effect, widely known from the film <em>The Matrix</em>, is a digitally-enhanced simulation of slow motion in which the camera (and thus the audienceâ€™s optical point-of-view) moves around the scene at a normal speed while film events are slowed down. <br />The opposite of slow motion is <a href="lex_fast_motion_en.html">fast motion</a>. <p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_slow_motion.png" src="Images/visual_slow_motion_en.png" width="100" /></p>
