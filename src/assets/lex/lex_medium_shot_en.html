	<body><strong>medium shot:</strong> This shot usually shows half of the subject, generally from the hip or waist up, which means that the subject and surroundings have more or less equal importance. Probably due in large part to this balance between the subject and the surroundings, medium shot is the most widely-used shot in <a href="lex_narrative_en.html">narrative films</a>.
