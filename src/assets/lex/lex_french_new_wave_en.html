	<body><strong>French New Wave (French: La Nouvelle Vague):</strong> A <a href="lex_film_movement_en.html">film movement</a> of the late 1950s and 1960s, which largely originated among young French film critics, who turned to filmmaking as a reaction against the traditional French film industry, which in their opinion, was not spontaneous and adventurous enough.<br /> Some of the most prominent pioneers among the group, which included François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette, began as critics for the famous Paris-based film magazine <em>Cahiers du Cinéma</em>. André Bazin, the co-founder of the magazine and film fellow theorist, was a prominent voice and source of influence for the movement. </body>
