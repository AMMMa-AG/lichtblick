	<body><strong>actor and acting:</strong> Acting is the art of portraying a character that is typically not identical with the actor’s own personality and giving the audience the impression that the fictional story they are seeing could be real. The actor is the person who creates this form of art largely by using appropriate characteristics of speech, facial expressions and gestures. As part of this, knowledge about <a href="lex_body_language_en.html">body language</a> and its effects on other people is of major importance. Although some actors do mostly play roles in accordance with their own personality, others are very attentive and permanently watch people’s behaviour to continually further their knowledge about body language, different types of characters and the full spectrum of human emotions. The techniques trained in acting schools vary depending on their basic attitude towards acting.
