	<body><strong>realistic setting:</strong> The term “<a href="lex_realism_en.html">realism</a>” is related to the representation of objects and conditions as they actually are in reality or how they were in the past. In keeping with this, a realistic setting involves the representation of living spaces or other locations in a form that is as close as possible to how they actually are or were. Often real locations are chosen as <a href="lex_realistic_setting_en.html">shooting locations</a> for realistic settings, but it is also common to use especially-constructed <a href="lex_set_en.html">sets</a>. Whichever form is chosen, filmmakers always select <a href="lex_setting_en.html">settings</a> and shooting locations in accordance with their special needs and requirements for their vision of how they want to realise the story. In this respect, even realistic settings show only a controlled selection of realistic conditions, and in addition, are often full of <a href="lex_stereotype_en.html">stereotypes</a> that are being played with by the filmmaker or <a href="lex_prop_en.html">props</a> and <a href="lex_decoration_en.html">decoration</a> that are designed to have specific effects on how the viewers see the scene. It is also possible for nonrealistic actions to take place in realistic settings.
