	<body><strong>high-key lighting:</strong> One of the main lighting styles used in filmmaking and often associated with the bright overall lighting that is best known from sitcoms and ballroom scenes. High-key lighting is characterized by a small ratio between the <a href="lex_key_light_en.html">key light</a> and <a href="lex_fill_light_en.html">fill light</a>. Normally, it is used in combination with <a href="lex_soft_light_soft_lighting_en.html">soft light</a> to create a pleasant atmosphere, which produces low <a href="lex_contrast_en.html">contrasts</a> between lit and shady areas. High-key lighting can also be useful for creating positive moods at night, or when used in combination with hard light sources, to create a cold and sterile atmosphere.
