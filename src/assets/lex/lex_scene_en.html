	<body><strong>scene:</strong> A series of interrelated <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shots</a> in a <a href="lex_narrative_en.html">narrative film</a> evoking the impression of continuous action that usually takes place in a single time and place, often with the same characters. Sometimes a single scene may contain two lines of action occurring in different places or even different times that are related by means of <a href="lex_cross_cut_en.html">crosscutting</a>. Several interrelated scenes make up <a href="lex_sequence_en.html">sequences</a> that do not obey the spatial and temporal unities of a single scene. A whole scene which is rendered in one single shot is called a <a href="lex_sequence_shot_en.html">sequence shot</a> (or plan scene, plan-s√©quence). The end of a scene is often indicated by a change in time, action and/or location.</body>
