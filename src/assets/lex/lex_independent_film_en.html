	<body><strong>independent film:</strong> A Film which is made outside the commercial mainstream of the <a href="lex_classical_Hollywood_cinema_en.html">classical Hollywood cinema</a> and <a href="lex_studio_en.html">studios</a>. Usually, the makers of such films have only a <a href="lex_low_budget_film_en.html">low budget</a> at their disposal, which is why independent productions are normally made without costly special effects or production expenses and without high salaries for the cast and crew. Some films are produced by the <a href="lex_director_en.html">director</a> him- or herself, especially when he or she is unable to secure funding elsewhere. Sometimes the cast and crew have even agreed to work for a salary that is lower than usual because they believe strongly in the project. Such films are normally shot at cheap <a href="lex_location_en.html">locations</a> or in independent studios that charge lower fees. As the filmmakers of independent films are not bound by the need to cover high expenses by achieving high profits at the box office, they have more freedom in the choice of themes and filming styles. As a result, these films often tend to be more <a href="lex_experimental_film_en.html">experimental</a> and controversial than classical Hollywood productions. <br />
		<br /> Since the 1990s, independent productions have become more and more popular, which has led many Hollywood studios to start supporting independent productions. This is why nowadays, many independent films have tended to merge with those of the mainstream Hollywood industry once again and have thus started to become very professional indeed. An important consequence is that it makes it increasingly hard to succeed for those filmmakers who still want to stay completely independent of the big studios.</body>
