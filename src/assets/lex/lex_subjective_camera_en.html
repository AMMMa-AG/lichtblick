	<body><strong>subjective camera:</strong> A camera that involves the viewers directly in the action, thus letting them participate more strongly in the atmosphere of a shot. A subjective camera is typically positioned near the characters so that the viewer can more easily witness their perception, feelings or state of mind. In keeping with this, the camera performs a lot of movements, such as <a href="lex_panning_en.html">panning</a> or <a href="lex_tilting_en.html">tilting</a> to simulate the eye of a directly involved person.<br />
		<br /> The most subjective viewpoint a camera can have is the <a href="lex_point_of_view_shot_en.html">point-of-view shot</a>. The opposite of this is the <a href="lex_objective_camera_en.html">objective camera</a>. <br />
