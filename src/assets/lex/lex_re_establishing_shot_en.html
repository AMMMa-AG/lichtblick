	<body><strong>re-establishing shot:</strong> A shot that reminds the viewers of the spatial layout of the scene and the respective positions of the characters in relation to it. The re-establishing shot once again draws attention to the location, which was previously recognized and noted by the viewers in the <a href="lex_establishing_shot_en.html">establishing shot</a>. Between several closer shots, the director will periodically provide a re-establishing shot, in order to refresh the viewersâ€™ sense of the overall geography of the scene. In addition, re-establishing shots often appear at the end of a <a href="lex_scene_en.html">scene</a> as a kind of conclusion.</body>
