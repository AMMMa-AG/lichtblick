	<body><strong>medium close-up:</strong> A shot in which less than half of the subject fills most of the frame and seems relatively large. People are normally shown from the chest or shoulder up to their head, which corresponds to the view one would have when standing face-to-face to a person and to the half-length portrait in painting and photography.
