	<body><strong>tracking shot:</strong> A tracking shot is any shot in which the camera films while being smoothly moved around. In most cases, the camera is mounted on a <a href="lex_dolly_en.html">dolly</a> that glides on tracks (hence the name). However, a dolly or any other kind of mobile support allowing for smooth movement may also move on wheels. Tracking shots can be achieved using a great variety of different devices such as a <a href="lex_crane_en.html">crane</a>, <a href="lex_steadicam_en.html">Steadicam</a>, or a well-supported handheld camera (e.g. a handheld camera on a wheelchair). The verbs <em>to track</em> and <em>to dolly</em> are often used synonymously.<br /> A tracking shot usually moves with a character (or an object), but if the camera follows a subject over a lengthy period of time, this kind of shot is then called a <a href="lex_following_shot_en.html">following shot</a>.<br /> With regard to possible tracking movements, there is a great variety available to cinematographers. However, the most common are:<br />
		<br />
		<ul>
			<li>The camera moves (tracks) towards a subject or object (track in).</li>
			<li>The camera moves (tracks) away from a subject or object (track out or track back).</li>
			<li>The camera tracks along with a subject or object (e.g. a vehicle) in the same direction (tracking within).</li>
			<li>The camera tracks a subject but moves in the opposite direction (countermove).</li>
			<li>The camera tracks around a subject or object in a circle (<a href="lex_circle_shot_en.html">circle shot</a>).</li>
		</ul>
