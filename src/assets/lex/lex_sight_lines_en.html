	<body><strong>sight line</strong>: An imaginary axis that runs between the eyes of a person and the subject or object that is in focus. Sight lines draw the viewer’s attention to specific parts of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en scène</a> (this is particularly important in <a href="lex_long_take_en.html">long takes</a>). In rare cases, the sight line of an actor may directly meet the lens, so that the character seems to be looking directly into the eyes of the viewer (see <a href="lex_90_degree_shot_en.html">90-degree-shot</a>). Nevertheless, since this is very obtrusive and confronting, films in the tradition of <a href="lex_continuity_editing_en.html">continuity editing</a> generally try to prevent such a direct addressing of the viewer. The sight lines of the various subjects in a shot can form special shapes (e.g. a <a href="lex_triangle_en.html">triangle</a>). For this reason, sight lines should be taken into account in the analysis of a shot’s <a href="lex_composition_en.html">composition</a>. </body>
