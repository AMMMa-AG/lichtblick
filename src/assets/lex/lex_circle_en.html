	<body><strong>circle:</strong> The circle is a basic shape that can be used for compositional aspects within the <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a>. Circles can be implemented as a concrete shape formed by one or more objects of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en scène</a>. In addition, circles can arise from <a href="lex_cast_shadow_en.html">cast shadows</a> and <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a> effects or even from non-physical connections between various faces, subjects or objects. They can also take the shape of a spiral which often creates a certain pull effect. Another circular shape is the ellipsis, which represents a flattened circle.<br /> In contrast to the <a href="lex_rectangle_en.html">rectangle</a> and due to its soft and smooth appearance, the circle is typically associated with natural and harmonic settings. A <a href="lex_composition_en.html">composition</a> based on circles may suggest comforting security and harmonious closure, whereas the use of spirals often visually creates a whirling effect, which may hint at confusion or turmoil. A circle naturally focuses the viewer’s attention towards its centre, which is a point of special importance. Other basic shapes are <a href="lex_line_en.html">lines</a>, <a href="lex_rectangle_en.html">rectangles</a> and <a href="lex_triangle_en.html">triangles</a>.<p align="center"><img lw-src="../bilder/shape_circle.png" src="Images/shape_circle_en.png" /></p>
