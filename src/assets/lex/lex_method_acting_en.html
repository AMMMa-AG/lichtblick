	<body><strong>method acting:</strong> Method acting is an acting technique that originated in the 1950s, as Elia Kazan and Lee Strasberg began developing and refining approaches they had picked up from the Russian actor and director Konstantin Stanislawski. <a href="lex_actor_acting_en.html">Actors</a> following this approach try to find the personality traits required by the role within themselves. In this respect the technique is closely related to psychoanalysis and uses the personal experiences of the actors to enable them to call up strong emotions immediately and repeatably. </body>
