	<body><strong>focal length:</strong> The focal length of an optical lens is a measure of how strongly it converges (focuses) or diverges (defocuses) rays of light. A lens with a shorter focal length bends the rays more strongly, bringing them to a focus in a shorter distance. In cinematography and photography, longer focal length (as is the case for <a href="lex_telephoto_lens_en.html">telephoto lenses</a>) is associated with a larger magnification of distant objects, and a narrower angle of view. Conversely, shorter focal length (as is the case for <a href="lex_wide_angle_lens_en.html">wide-angle lenses</a>) is associated with a wider angle of view.</body>
