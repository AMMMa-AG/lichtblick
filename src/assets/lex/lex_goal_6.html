	<body><strong class="title">Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation</strong><p>Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.</p>
		<p> One in three people live without sanitation. This is causing unnecessary disease and death. Although huge strides have been made with access to clean drinking water, lack of sanitation is undermining these advances. If we provide affordable equipment and education in hygiene practices, we can stop this senseless suffering and loss of life. </p>
