	<body><strong>dolly zoom:</strong> A dolly zoom combines a <a href="lex_track_in_en.html">track in</a> or <a href="lex_track_out_en.html">track out</a> movement with the apparent movement of a <a href="lex_zoom_shot_en.html">zoom</a> in the opposite direction. Depending on whether it is a dolly out/zoom in, or a dolly in/zoom out, either the background shifts towards the foreground or away from it. The respective zooming direction and additional perspective changes caused by the camera movement produce either a special dizzying or oppressive effect. A dolly zoom is also variously known as “dolly counter zoom”, “reverse tracking shot”, the “Hitchcock zoom”, the “Vertigo effect”, or the “Trombone effect”. </body>
