	<body><strong>fast motion (accelerated motion):</strong> An effective way to condense time in film. Through the use of fast motion, action appears faster on screen than it would occur in reality. Generally, unless special effects are desired, the camera records images at 24 frames per second. To produce fast motion, the camera records images at a slower speed than the speed of the projection (for instance, 16 frames per second); subsequent projection of 24 frames per second then speeds up the action. Fast motion is often used in comedy, but can also be effective in dramatic situations or nature films. Events and processes that would normally appear subtle to the human eye, such as the motion of the sun and stars in the sky or the growing of plants, become very pronounced. An extreme form of fast motion is <a href="lex_time_lapse_cinematography_en.html">time-lapse cinematography</a>.
