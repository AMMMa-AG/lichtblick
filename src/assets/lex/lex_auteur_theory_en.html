	<body><strong>auteur theory:</strong> A theory that states that a director’s films reflect that particular director’s personal creative and artistic vision. In line with this theory, the director is regarded as the “auteur” (French for “author”) of a film because he/she has primary control and responsibility for the final product. A basic tenor of auteur theory is that a film should be considered in terms of the entire canon of films made by a director displaying a unique cinematic style, and for this reason, the auteur theory has had an important impact on film criticism. In particular, it is often associated with the <a href="lex_french_new_wave_en.html">French new wave</a> and the film critics who wrote for the influential French film review periodical <em>Cahiers du Cinéma</em>.</body>
