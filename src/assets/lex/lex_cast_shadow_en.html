	<body><strong>cast shadow:</strong> A subject that partially blocks out the light and casts a shadow on another object or subject. For instance, a character who is lit from the front and whose silhouette is then cast on the wall behind or light that shines through the slits of venetian blinds thus casting shadows on any objects or the subject on the other side.
