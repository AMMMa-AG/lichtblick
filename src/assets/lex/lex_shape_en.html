	<body><strong>Shapes:</strong> Shapes within the <a href="lex_frame_en.html">frame</a> are a very important tool for filmmakers in order to direct the viewer's attention and to achieve a certain <a href="lex_composition_en.html">compositional</a> setting. The effect shapes can have on the viewer depends on the context of the shot, in particular, and the context of the film, in general. Nevertheless, shapes typically have a strong impact on the viewer's experience or emotional response to a <a href="lex_shot_en.html">shot</a>. For this reason, you can generally assume that their appearance in a frame is not by coincidence.<br />Shapes can be implemented as a concrete shape formed by one or more objects of the <a href="lex_mise_en_scene_en.html">mise en sc√®ne</a>. In addition, however, shapes can arise from <a href="lex_cast_shadow_en.html">shadows</a> and <a href="lex_lighting_en.html">lighting</a> effects or even from lines formed by non-physical connections between several faces, subjects or objects.<br />
		<br /> In terms of composition, <a href="lex_line_en.html">lines</a> and the following three basic shapes are of particular importance: <ul>
			<li><a href="lex_triangle_en.html">triangle</a>,</li>
			<li><a href="lex_circle_en.html">circle</a>,</li>
			<li><a href="lex_rectangle_en.html">rectangle</a>.</li>
		</ul>
