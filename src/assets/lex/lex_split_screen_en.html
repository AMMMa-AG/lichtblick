	<body><strong>split screen:</strong> A technique that shows a visible division of the screen, traditionally in half, but which can also be in several simultaneous images. Each division may show independent action or the same action from different viewpoints. Split screen is usually intended to signify simultaneous action (see also <a href="lex_cross_cut_en.html">cross-cutting</a>). Split screen appears highly artificial to the viewer, significantly disturbing the illusion that the screenâ€™s frame is a window on reality.</body>
