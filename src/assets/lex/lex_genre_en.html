	<body><strong>genre (film):</strong> A category label used to classify <a href="lex_fiction_en.html">fictional</a> film based on a loose set of defining features or stylistic criteria. Over time, genres come to be associated with certain <a href="lex_genre_en.html">conventions</a> that nevertheless change continually as new genres are developed and older ones fall out of use. For this reason, genre is always a vague term with no fixed boundaries, and often, a film fits into multiple genres.<br />Some common film genres are action films, westerns, science-fiction films, thrillers, horror films, gangster films, musicals.</body>
