	<body><strong>subsequent point-of-view (shot):</strong> A special form of <a href="lex_point_of_view_shot_en.html">point-of-view shot</a>, in which the viewers see something or someone within a frame without any indication that this might represent the point-of-view of another person. The subsequent cut to another shot then reveals a character observing what was in the first shot. In a certain sense, the subsequent point-of-view shot can be regarded as a reversed <a href="lex_gaze_shot_en.html">gaze shot</a>. This kind of point-of-view shot often introduces an element of surprise.</body>
