	<body><strong>freeze frame:</strong> A special effect in a shot, which creates the impression of a pause in the action or a still photograph. This effect is accomplished by reprinting one frame many times, usually with an optical printer or by means of digital editing. As such, it differs from the “freeze frame” or still frame option found on DVD players to individually pause the playback of a film. A freeze frame in a film is often used in combination with <a href="lex_voice_over_en.html">voice-over</a> narration to situate the plot in time or to comment on a character’s thoughts and feelings.<p align="center"><img height="100" lw-src="../bilder/visual_freeze_frame.png" src="Images/visual_freeze_frame_en.png" width="100" /></p>
